# 0x02-ES6_classes

## 0. You used to attend a place like this at some point

Implement a class named `ClassRoom`:

- Prototype: `export default class ClassRoom`
- It should accept one attribute named `maxStudentsSize` (Number) and assigned to `_maxStudentsSize`

## 1. Let's make some classrooms

Import the `ClassRoom` class from `0-classroom.js`.

Implement a function named `initializeRooms`. It should return an array of 3 `ClassRoom` objects with the sizes 19, 20, and 34 (in this order).
